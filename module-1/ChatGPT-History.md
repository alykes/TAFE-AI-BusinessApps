# History of ChatGPT and OpenAI

In 2015, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Greg Brokman, and Wojciech Zaremba founded OpenAI to develop safe and accessible AI tools. OpenAI also introduced DALL-E, a Generative AI model based on GPT-2 that is capable of generating photorealistic images.  

## ChatGPT by comparison

Search engines like Google and Bing used to use more limited AI enablement that would sort and rank information from massive datasets. A good example is a personalised list of movie recommendations. Google search engines rank and return results from a user's input of keywords and shape how we think and function by the decisions they make in prioritising vast amounts of information.  

> ChatGPT's capability to provide a unified answer is poised to affect our thinking and behaviour far more than ranking systems. For example, the prevailing public perception of this single-answer option is that ChatGPT is more intelligent, less biased, and more truthful than any other source. This perception is wrong.  

ChatGPT differs from software programs like AI forms, search engines, chatbots, advanced analytics, and business intelligence (BI) software due to its unique ability to generate content. Unlike chatbots that rely on pre-written responses triggered by keywords or user questions, _ChatGPT generates responses based on the user's prompt_. The underlying mechanism of ChatGPT is quite different from that of traditional chatbots. In ChatGPT, _the interaction occurs through natural language input_, allowing users to command or query the model without coding. ChatGPT creates a dynamic conversation-like experience that appears highly intelligent.
