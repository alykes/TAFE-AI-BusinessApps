## Module outcomes

Upon completion of Fundamental concepts of Generative AI module, you will be able to:

- Describe the fundamental concepts of Generative AI.

## Introduction

**General Intelligence can be seen as:**

- Knowledge and data is very important, they lead to analytical intelligence.
  - leads us into analytical intelligence.
- Creativity is the component that allows us to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
  - leads us into generative intelligence.
- General skills lead us into cognitive intelligence.

We use all these things to complete processes, like making a bed or making a cup of tea.

**Artificial intelligence is then:**

- DIs designing and developing a system to acquire and apply knowledge and skills to complete a specific process.
- This leads us into 3 distinct AI systems:
  - Analytical AI
    - mining, ranking, rating, understanding the data.
    - understanding the data
  - Cognitive AI
    - Decision making
  - Generative AI
    - Is the capability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills to complete a specific process.

Artificial Intelligence is mainly _generative AI_.
Tools that use AI; Chatgpt (text), DALL-E (images), WALL-E (speech), Github Co-pilot (code).
Process, all these AI systems help in _generating_ processes, _augmenting_ processes and _improving_ the process.

## What is Generative AI?

Type of artificial intelligence of creating a wide range of data, such as images, videos, audio, text and 3D models. Generative AI learns patterns from existing data and then uses this knowledge to generative new and unique outputs. The output is highly realistic and can mimic humans, thereby making it a valuable tool.  

Generative AI can learn from various sources and generate new content that reflects the characteristics of the training data but does not repeat it.

- Generative AI uses several techniques that continue to evolve.  
- At a fundamental level, it uses AI models to train on a broad set of unlabelled data that can be used for different tasks, with additional fine-tuning.
- It requires complex maths and enormous computing power to train these models, the essence of their prediction algorithms. GenAI is most commonly used to create content in response to natural language requests.

## Types of Generative AI

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS)**
  - GANs use deep learning in unsupervised data discovery, e.g., applications generating photorealistic images and complex but real image editing.
  - generate realistic and high-quality data, such as images, audio, and text.
- **Transformer-Based Models**
  - These are used to generate text, speech, images and other content by discerning context, meaning and patterns, e.g., ChatGPT and DALL-E.
  - are used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and speech.
- **Variational Auto-encoders (VAES)**
  - VAEs comprise of two difference neural networks of encoders and decoders, e.g., security analytics, anomaly detections and signal processing.
  - are used in security analytics, anomaly detection, and signal processing.

**ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) foundation is **LLM** (Large Language Model). **LLM** is a computer algorithm that processes natural language inputs and predicts the next word based on what it has already seen.
